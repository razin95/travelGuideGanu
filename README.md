# Visit Terengganu (Tourism Web-Based Application)

## 📌 Project Overview

**Visit Terengganu** is a web-based tourism platform aimed at promoting the travel and cultural heritage of Terengganu, Malaysia. This application serves both tourists and administrators. Tourists can explore attractions, accommodations, current weather and image place while admins can manage all tourism-related content like add, edit or update and delete tourist attraction and accommodation.

The system addresses the fragmentation of information by offering a centralized, user-friendly hub that enhances the travel planning experience and supports the digitalization of Terengganu's tourism industry.
